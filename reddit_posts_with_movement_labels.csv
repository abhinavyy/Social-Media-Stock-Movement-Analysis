Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,52,1gxezqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxezqq/are_we_putting_too_much_faith_in_generative_ai/,1732300870.0,2024-11-23,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,40,1gwxwu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwxwu8/intuit_shares_drop_as_quarterly_forecast_misses/,1732244313.0,2024-11-22,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday",27,1gwro36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwro36/gap_shares_surge_as_it_raises_guidance_touts/,1732226608.0,2024-11-22,"Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,0,1gxinau,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxinau/manchester_united_stock_nyse_manu_potential_to/,1732310301.0,2024-11-23,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow.

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",11,palo alto networks beats q estimates shares fall billings decline bod approves stock split,httpswwwmsncomenusmoneytopstockspaloaltostockisfallingafterearningsbeatwhythismetricsworryinganalystsaraauuoywocidfinanceverthpfeedshttpswwwmsncomenusmoneytopstockspaloaltostockisfallingafterearningsbeatwhythismetricsworryinganalystsaraauuoywocidfinanceverthpfeeds quarter ended october palo alto networks reported adjusted earnings per share versus consensus estimate revenue totaled b versus estimate b quarter progress palo alto networks expects adjusted earnings per share range midpoint matches estimate revenue projection second quarter ranges b b represents growth year year midpoint b comes estimate b second quarter nextgeneration security arr expected range b b would represent yearoveryear increase total revenue fiscal year runs august july expected range b b would represent growth year year platformization progress continued q driving strong financial results said dipak golechha chief financial officer palo alto networks result raising ngs arr revenue nongaap eps guidance year board directors also approved twoforone stock split increase number authorized common shares b b trading splitadjusted basis expected begin dec ive big fan panw last years billings decline isnt great expected company pushes platformization anticipate great long term outlook short term may seem like growth slowing platformization make services sticky harder companies leave theyll integrated across business across multiple levels although im big fan stock admit expensive one lot hinges future growth whole industry signs slowed growth think one hurt investors buying levels im cybersecurity im sure likelihood id keep eye ive made several posts panw last year consensus continue buy monthly theres large pull back ill look make large purchase cash reserves,0.5994,0.9893,positive,positive,"{'AMD': 0, 'AAPL': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'MSFT': 0, 'GOOG': 0}","{'AMD': 0, 'AAPL': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'MSFT': 0, 'GOOG': 0}",0,"{'rally': 0, 'bull': 0, 'bear': 0, 'crash': 0, 'growth': 0, 'dip': 0}","{'rally': 0, 'bull': 0, 'bear': 0, 'crash': 0, 'growth': 5, 'dip': 0}",5,up
Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,356,1gw7gn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gw7gn4/adani_group_shares_nosedive_after_chairman_gautam/,1732161837.0,2024-11-21,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

It said it expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to range from $8.30 to $8.90.

Target now expects fourth-quarter comparable sales to be approximately flat. That metric, which is also known as same-store sales, includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months. 

Target fell short of Wall Street’s earnings per share estimate by 20%, its biggest miss in two years. It also marked its first revenue miss since August 2023.

If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",29,viking therapeutics inc brainer buy right,research really beleive stock gold viking therapeutics shared updates obesity treatment program vk obesityweek subjects achieved mean weight loss baseline placeboadjusted weight loss days daily dosing mg far concerned believe effective mounjaro demonstrated average weight loss approximately starting body weight weeks treatment also oral vk demonstrated favorable safety profile adverse events classified mild moderate oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments offering greater convenience lets look subcutaneous vk resultor like doses weekly subcutaneous injections led weight reductions baseline treated patients achieved weight loss compared placebo weight loss progressive throughout study plateau weeks obesity drug market projected grow billion offering significant upside vk also important size market hold many multiple big players analysts also predict viking could become takeover target due strong pipeline would boost price digits whats company also received praise liver disease treatment vk showed positive results phase b trial mash metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis serious liver condition affecting million americans reductions liver fat ranging weeks response rates reduction high far exceed typical benchmarks clinical data reinforce vks potential bestinclass obesity treatment effective weight loss strong safety durability results reason stock hasnt skyrocketed fear mongering market makers aftermath rfk junior far im concerned diabete liver diseases go away desperation ive seen patients obtain drug mad,0.0,0.9662,neutral,positive,"{'AMD': 0, 'AAPL': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'MSFT': 0, 'GOOG': 0}","{'AMD': 0, 'AAPL': 0, 'TSLA': 0, 'MSFT': 0, 'GOOG': 0}",0,"{'rally': 0, 'bull': 0, 'bear': 0, 'crash': 0, 'growth': 0, 'dip': 0}","{'rally': 0, 'bull': 0, 'bear': 0, 'crash': 0, 'growth': 0, 'dip': 0}",0,up

Extract: The first vulnerability relates to financial markets, which remain susceptible to sudden, sharp adjustments. While recent high-volatility episodes were short-lived and had only limited impact on the financial system, underlying vulnerabilities make financial markets prone to bouts of volatility in the future. First, record-low equity premia and compressed corporate bond spreads are signs that investors may be underestimating the likelihood and potential impact of adverse scenarios. Second, concentration of equity market capitalisation and earnings among a handful of companies, notably in the United States, has increased greatly in recent years, raising concerns over the possibility of an asset price bubble connected to artificial intelligence.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry.

Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,252,1gukbfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gukbfk/super_micro_hires_new_auditor_to_maintain_nasdaq/,1731976303.0,2024-11-19,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

$8k is the only around 10% of my liquid investment (not counting 401k, etc).

S&P rebalancing presents a great opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is typically a \~5-10% price increase as a result of the rebalance and institutions buying + a positive brand bump.



Although the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is ""a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks."" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable.



Below is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):

Technology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |. Healthcare: 10.54% | Communication Services: 9.03% | Industrials: 7.58% | Consumer Defensive: 5.56% | Energy: 3.44% | Utilities: 2.54% | Real Estate: 2.17% | Basic Materials: 1.83%



**My target candidates for inclusion:**

Second if he does take the position its not going to stop or delay any current R&D, if anything it may speed up the approval process making it more efficient with less bureaucracy.

Third, what matters more is who the president elect appoints for FDA commissioner. Much like the SEC has a head the FDA does too. RFK will focus on fruit loops and the FDA will focus on pharma and their business because, he doesn't have a medical degree and will quickly realize he's out of his element.

Alibaba shares rise 3% in premarket after Chinese tech giant posts 58% jump in profit,257,1gruwrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gruwrl/alibaba_shares_rise_3_in_premarket_after_chinese/,1731672501.0,2024-11-15,"Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba on Friday beat profit expectations in its September quarter, citing an acceleration in growth in its cloud business unit.

Net income came in 43.9 billion Chinese yuan ($6.07 billion), compared with a LSEG outlook of 25.83 billion yuan.

Revenue reached 236.5 billion yuan ($32.72 billion), versus an analyst forecast of 238.9 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.

The company’s New York-listed shares have gained ground this year to date, up almost 17% as of Friday. The stock was up 3% in premarket trading at 11:43 a.m. London time, after the release of the quarterly earnings.

The results come at a tricky time for Chinese commerce businesses, given a tepid retail environment that reflects broader sluggishness in the world’s second-largest economy.

Markets are now watching whether a slew of recent stimulus measures from Beijing, including a five-year 1.4-trillion-yuan package announced last week, will help resuscitate the country’s growth and curtail a long-lived real estate market slump.

The impact on the retail space looks promising so far, with sales rising by a better-than-expected 4.8% year-on-year in October, while China’s recent Singles’ Day shopping holiday — widely seen as a barometer for national consumer sentiment — regained some of its luster.

Alibaba touted “robust growth” in gross merchandise volume — an industry measure of sales over time that does not equate to the company’s revenue — for its Taobao and Tmall Group businesses during the festival, along with a “record number of active buyers.”

“Alibaba’s outlook remains closely aligned with the trajectory of the Chinese economy and evolving regulatory policies,” ING analysts said Thursday, noting that the company’s Friday report will shed light on the Chinese economy’s growth momentum.

Why do shareholders of a company with positive shareholder equity still receive nothing in the event of bankruptcy?,53,1gqtwgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqtwgt/why_do_shareholders_of_a_company_with_positive/,1731549330.0,2024-11-14,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently looking at the situation with Spirit Airlines. I’m not a shareholder, but I was interested in the fact that they report about $807m in shareholder equity.

Spirit now claim that the bonds due in 2025 and 2026 are a problem, and they must renegotiate, likely resulting in a wipeout of shareholders and Chapter 11.

My question is, if the company has equity value remaining, why do the shareholders end up with nothing? Is it because the value of those assets would likely not stack up to the value of liabilities when liquidated/sold off (although I would assume depreciation accounts for that)? Or is it because the costs incurred during the bankruptcy process would exceed the shareholder equity in the company?

I can’t imagine the process would cost them $807m…

After some extensive research I landed on these 4 industries: robotics, cyber-security, beverages and industrial. 

The four companies I landed on were SYM, S, BROS, and ATMU. 

Symbiotic, $SYM is a robotic warehouse company located in Massachusetts. Its number one customer is Walmart and is also partnered with Target, Unfi. They are showing strong revenue growth and on the verge of positive net income. At 20 billion dollars it seems fairly valued when compared to other robotics companies like ABB which has a 100 billion dollar market cap. I think SYM has the opportunity to take some more of their market share. 

$S, SentinelOne, is a cyber-security company worth roughly 9 billion dollars. It can be compared to Cloudflare and Palo Alto. At about a quarter of the valuation, there is a lot of room for growth. 

$BROS, Dutch Bros is a coffee / beverage company that has been expanding like wild fire. It opened over 30 new shops last quarter. And just popped 30% after last earnings. I believe this company is on a similar trajectory as Starbucks, and seems to have even more momentum than Starbucks, Gen Z is obsessed with their drinks and the line is always very long. A risky growth play, but intriguing. 

$ATMU is a water filtration company valued at 3.6 billion and has a PE of 20 and has growing revenue and net income. A strong value play in my opinion, and very highly regarded by analysts. Seemed like a no brainer to me.

Supermicro - hold or sell - my strategy,38,1gqa9ht,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqa9ht/supermicro_hold_or_sell_my_strategy/,1731495213.0,2024-11-13,"Disclosure of related position: I bought Supermicro for my growth and momentum trading strategy back in January 2022 for $43.20 (split aligned $4.32) and then doubled down the 6th of September 2022 for $64.22 (split aligned $6.422). Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).

I took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.

But let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:

Hindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.

Now, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.

I was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.

Supermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.

I think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.

It is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.

"NICE Ltd., an undervalued AI stock that is positioned well whether or not generative AI even works",0,1gqi2n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gqi2n6/nice_ltd_an_undervalued_ai_stock_that_is/,1731518301.0,2024-11-13,"There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.

NICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.

NICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.

NICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.

To speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary ""co-pilot"", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. 

Some of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.

I also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. 

I'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.

TSMC Predictions,38,1gplak6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gplak6/tsmc_predictions/,1731419845.0,2024-11-12,"TSMC has been dropping lately due to export control clauses with the US, so right now it seems to be a possible entering time, here is my analysis:

  
1: In the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2024, there is an approved capital expenditure of around US$15.48 billion to support fab construction, technology capacity expansion, 2025 R&D, and sustaining capital expenditures. This means innovation and more profit.

  
2: Approved issuance of unsecured corporate bonds in Taiwan’s domestic market, up to NT$60 billion, for capacity expansion and pollution prevention efforts.

3: Approved the Business Report and Financial Statements for Q3 2024, reporting NT$759.69 billion in revenue and NT$325.26 billion in net income. The diluted earnings per share were NT$12.54.

4: In the Q3 report from TSMC: The projection for Q4 goes as followed:

**Revenue Projection**: US$26.1–$26.9 billion

* **Gross Profit Margin**: Expected between 57.0% and 59.0%
* **Operating Profit Margin**: Expected between 46.5% and 48.5%

Compare this to Q3:

* **Q3 2024 Actual Revenue**: **US$23.50 billion**
* **Q4 2024 Outlook Revenue**: **Between US$26.1 billion and US$26.9 billion**

  
**Q3 2024 Actual Profit Margin**: **57.8%**

* **Q4 2024 Outlook Profit Margin**: **Between 57.0% and 59.0%**

So TSMC expects similar efficiency while improved revenue, so I might buy some TSMC soon after some more dip.

How I’m performing the adf test:
1.Currently I’m downloading the historical data exporting it in an excel sheet.
2. Reading this file in the python and converting it into and array.
3. Using the adf function on the array and getting the results

This is a really hectic way and takes alot of time and energy. Haven’t made something similar for the hurst exponent yet as I don’t know whether these to tests will give me the mean reverting stocks or not.

I used chat gpt and it told me these to test to find out the stocks.

So I just want to know:
1. Whether these test will help me in finding mean reverting stocks or not.
2. If not, then how can I find them? What ways should I use?
3. If yes, then are these 2 test enough? And is there any platform which can help me perform these tests like just creating an excel sheet and uploading it into a tool and getting the results as this will be really helpful.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Long time lurker here (26M) who is looking for some general advice.

I do quarterly rebalancing for my personal portfolio, though I offset it slightly (mid-Feb, May, Aug, and Nov rather than the standard end-of-quarter timing). This past quarter was a strong one—I realized significant gains thanks to the market’s recent surge (up 98% YTD), which leaves me in a unique position as I plan my next moves.

Right now, I’m facing a bit of a dilemma. The market feels extremely saturated, yet I also hesitate to sit on the sidelines or try to time a correction. I want to be thoughtful about redeploying my gains, but I’m not seeing many places to confidently put new money to work.

How are others in the community building conviction in their holdings? It feels like I keep hearing two extremes: either people are incredibly bullish, riding the wave, or they’re wary of a correction—yet staying fully invested in names like Costco, which is trading at a 56 P/E.
